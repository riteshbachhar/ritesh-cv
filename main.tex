\section{Introduction}
This is a simple LaTeX document for demonstration purposes. Here, we introduce the document and its main objectives. LaTeX allows for very precise control over the presentation of text, math, and graphics, making it an ideal choice for academic publications.

\section{Mathematics}
LaTeX is widely used for typesetting mathematical content, thanks to its robust handling of mathematical notation. Here is an example of a simple equation:

\begin{equation}
    E = mc^2
\end{equation}

This equation, proposed by Einstein as part of his theory of relativity, describes the relationship between energy (E) and mass (m) with \( c \) being the speed of light in vacuum.

\section{Conclusion}
This document is created as a basic example to demonstrate the LaTeX capabilities in GitHub Actions for automating PDF generation from \TeX files.
